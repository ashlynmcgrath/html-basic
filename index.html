  <p>I am a history Master's student, currently in my <b>last</b> semester.</p>
  <p>I am very interested in in <b>late medieval/early modern</b> <i>European history,</i> specifically gender history.</p>
  <p> I have recently been reading about sexuality and gender roles during the French Revolution.</p>

  <p>I have no previous coding experience, but I am very interested in seeing how these <i>coding skills</i> will intersect with the <b>"typical" skills</b> historians primarily use for research.</p>
  <p>I am currently working at the <i>National</i> <b>Purple</b> Heart Museum, which exposes me to materials I don't <b>usually</b> study.</p>
